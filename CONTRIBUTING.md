# Contributing

Welcome! We need your help!

This is the first time I, @jannypie, have organized an Open Source project & the scope is ambitious. Advice, corrections & feedback are *highly sought & appreciated.* Thank you!

## All Skills Welcome

We need help of many types and from all levels! In addition to the technical work, we also need graphics, authors (to write educational material, articles), researchers (collecting sources on topics, fact-checkers, following the money), etc, etc.

*Beginners are welcome, including juniors.* Please keep this in mind and thoroughly document your work so that even starters can jump in.

**Juniors** if you are interested in helping on a topic, post a comment on the issue offering your help. Include what background knowledge you might have, so that experienced devs have an idea of a starting point. Some examples might be, "Have written controllers but need practice" or "No background but very interested in learning"

**All contributors**, please consider inviting a junior to pair with you as you work on these issues. If a junior has expressed interest in your issue, please contact them and work out ways to collaborate.

This is not meant to stall work, but rather to provide learning opportunities and create an inclusive project.

## Code of Conduct

Contributors must agree to the [Contributor Covent](http://contributor-covenant.org/) code of conduct guidelines.

## Getting set up locally

1. Fork the repo and git clone to your machine
1. `cd` into the repo folder
1. `bundle install` dependencies
1. `rake db:migrate` to set up the database
1. `rails s` to start server
1. Open localhost:3000 in your browser to see the welcome page
1. Project details
  - Ruby 2.2.5
  - Rails 5.1.1

### Considerations

All work should be done with the following considerations:

- Security of Authentication and Access
- Accessibility of Code and Design

## Contributing to Current Development

Please [start here](https://github.com/fifthbymidwest/fifthbymidwest.github.io/projects/1) on the planning board to see which issues are ready to be tackled.

Fork the repo to your account, then clone down into your local environment.

Start the servers, and make sure you can see the app loading on `localhost:3000`.

Make changes and commit often! Please [follow guidelines](https://github.com/erlang/otp/wiki/Writing-good-commit-messages) for good, small commits.

Write tests. Make tests pass with `bundle exec rake`.

Push changes back up to your fork.

Submit a *Pull Request to the `develop` branch*.

We will review PRs and give feedback, suggestions, or other response.

## Creating new Issues for Development

Please use this template for generating new issues/user stories. Keep in mind that junior developers are invited to join this project, so we try to keep things Best Practiced and Well Documented around here.
